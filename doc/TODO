### NOW ###
    include corner cases in project as reference c code files
        check if there are all corner cases and add more if necessary
        make sure all corner cases are covered or included in to do

### SOON ###
    add or extend tests
        for MacroExpander (extend test)
            maybe also test mutated tokens
            test nesting
            test case 19 (macro precedence when macro call itself is constructed inside a macro from parameter)
            test case 20 (macro call is missing arguments, but macro require arguments, so token is added as is)

        for MacroProcessor
            add test for nesting and unnesting ?
            add test for undef ?
            add test for error ?

        for MacroBranches
        for MacroExpressions
        for MacroExpansionServices
        for MacroCallValidator
        for MacroExpansionService implementations
        for MacroTrueBranchProcessor
        for MacroFalseBranchProcessor
        for MacroCompletedBranchProcessor

### LATER ###
    macros
        add possibility to collect macro calls
            maybe as optional parameter to Preprocessor ?

        add support for ## macro joining operation
            it can join tokens of different types
            some combination of token types are invalid
            result should always form a single token
            otherwise warning or error should be thrown
            looks like spaces are ignored as if they didn't exist

        add support for vararg macros
        add support for include directive
        report correct position in MacroTrueBranchProcessor for error and warning
            maybe try to correct token positions earlier after parsing if possible
