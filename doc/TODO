### NOW ###
    ... fixing preprocessor test
        ... so, for *undefined* macro inside expression, it should evaluate to 0, not as "no token"
            ... see test 2 on desktop

### SOON ###
    ...

### LATER ###
    so it looks like there are more cases uncovered (case 27)
        brackets for defined operator are optional for some reason
        #if defined xyz

    consider whether Preprocessor should be stateful
        Tokenizer could be passed as parameter

    add tests
        for MacroTrueBranchProcessor
        for MacroFalseBranchProcessor
        for MacroCompletedBranchProcessor

    make sure all corner cases are covered with tests or included in to do
        see cz.mg.c.preprocessor.cases in test folder

    macros
        add support for macro stringification operator (#)
        add support for vararg macro parameters
        add support for include directive
