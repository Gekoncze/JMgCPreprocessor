    so it looks like that macro processing requires spaces
        macro parameter list only counts when where is no space between bracket and macro name
        change concatenation operator to check for space tokens instead

### LATER ###
    consider whether Preprocessor should be stateful
        Tokenizer could be passed as parameter

    add tests
        for MacroTrueBranchProcessor
        for MacroFalseBranchProcessor
        for MacroCompletedBranchProcessor

    make sure all corner cases are covered with tests or included in to do
        see cz.mg.c.preprocessor.cases in test folder

    macros
        add support for macro stringification operator (#)
        add support for vararg macro parameters
        add support for include directive
