### NOW ###
    add test for infinite recursive macro expansion
        during recursion, macro can be expanded only once

### SOON ###
    add tests
        for macro package
            for MacroProcessor
                add test for nesting and unnesting ?
                add test for undef ?
                add test for error ?

            for MacroBranches
            for MacroExpander
            for MacroExpressions
            for MacroExpansionServices
            for MacroCallValidator
            for MacroExpansionService implementations
            for MacroTrueBranchProcessor
            for MacroFalseBranchProcessor
            for MacroCompletedBranchProcessor

### LATER ###
    macros
        add possibility to collect macro calls
            maybe as optional parameter to Preprocessor ?

        add support for ## macro joining operation
            it can join tokens of different types
            some combination of token types are invalid
            result should always form a single token
            otherwise warning or error should be thrown
            looks like spaces are ignored as if they didn't exist

        add support for vararg macros
        add support for include directive
        report correct position in MacroTrueBranchProcessor for error and warning
            maybe try to correct token positions earlier after parsing if possible
