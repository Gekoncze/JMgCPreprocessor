TODO
    in ExpressionProcessor (add test first)
    in MacroExpansionService

backslash processing should be run before tokenizer
    but that would mess up traceability
        unless position service counted with backslashes

macros
    check if whitespaces make sense for macro processing

    add support for ## macro joining operation
        investigate what should be the result token type
        investigate what token types should be joined together and when

    add support for vararg macros
