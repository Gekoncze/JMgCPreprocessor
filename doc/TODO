macros
    check if whitespaces make sense for macro processing
        if we keep newlines for macro processing, then don't forget to remove them afterwards
        check that newlines will not be removed (together with whitespaces) before they are processed
        consider tokenizing operators that stand next to each other (replacing operator processor)

add tests
    ExpressionProcessor
    for macro package
    for Preprocessor

TODO
    in ExpressionProcessor (add test first)
    in MacroExpansionService

macros

        some combination of token types are invalid
        result should always form a single token
        otherwise warning or error should be thrown

    add support for vararg macros
