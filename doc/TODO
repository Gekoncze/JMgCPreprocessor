    so it looks like that macro processing requires spaces
        adapt remaining code to count with whitespaces during macro processing
            fixing directive parsers one by one from top to bottom (order by name)
                ... next to do is MacroParser

### SOON ###
    ...

### LATER ###
    add support for message parsing for error and warning directive
        it should be possible now that spaces are kept

    consider whether Preprocessor should be stateful
        Tokenizer could be passed as parameter

    add tests
        for MacroTrueBranchProcessor
        for MacroFalseBranchProcessor
        for MacroCompletedBranchProcessor

    make sure all corner cases are covered with tests or included in to do
        see cz.mg.c.preprocessor.cases in test folder

    macros
        add support for macro stringification operator (#)
        add support for vararg macro parameters
        add support for include directive
