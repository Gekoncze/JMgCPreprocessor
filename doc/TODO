    add or extend tests
        for MacroProcessor
            add test for nesting and unnesting ?
            add test for undef ?
            add test for error ?

        for MacroBranches
        for MacroExpressions
        for MacroExpansionServices
        for MacroCallValidator
        for MacroExpansionService implementations
        for MacroTrueBranchProcessor
        for MacroFalseBranchProcessor
        for MacroCompletedBranchProcessor
        for PlainMacroExpansionService
        for DefinedMacroExpansionService
        for FileMacroExpansionService
        for LineMacroExpansionService

### LATER ###
    consider to do in JMgTokenizer

    make sure all corner cases are covered with tests or included in to do
        see cz.mg.c.preprocessor.cases

    macros
        add possibility to collect macro calls
            maybe as optional parameter to Preprocessor ?

        add support for ## macro joining operation
            it can join tokens of different types
            some combination of token types are invalid
            result should always form a single token
            otherwise warning or error should be thrown
            looks like spaces are ignored as if they didn't exist
            test case 19

        add support for vararg macros
        add support for include directive

        report correct position in MacroTrueBranchProcessor for error and warning
            maybe try to correct token positions earlier after parsing if possible
