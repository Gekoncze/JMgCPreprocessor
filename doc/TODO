macros
    check if whitespaces make sense for macro processing
        if we keep newlines for macro processing, then don't forget to remove them afterwards
        check that newlines will not be removed (together with whitespaces) before they are processed
        consider tokenizing operators that stand next to each other (replacing operator processor)

add tests
    for expression package
        expression processor

    for macro package

    for processors package
        newline processor
        operator processor
        whitespace processor

    for preprocessor

TODO
    in ExpressionProcessor (add test first)
    in MacroExpansionService
